<b>Description</b>:
<br/>
The NSW Work Health and Safety regulations require that all hazardous chemicals be appropriately labelled. A new global system for the classification and labelling of chemicals (GHS) is being introduced within Australia. By the beginning of 2017, all chemicals containers must have labels which meet GHS requirements.  To assist workers in meeting these compliance requirements, in the workspaces at the University of Sydney, Safety Health and Wellbeing wish to create a web based tool that will allow users to select correct classification data to produce chemical labels of different sizes and detail, which can then be printed and placed on a chemical container.

<b>Description</b>:
<br/>
As one of the scientists working within the Dairy Science Group at Camden (USYD),
Dr Clark has drawn together a group of farmers from across the state to help direct research.
This project answers a key need they have identified to make it easier for farmers to reliably 
manage and track their chemical use.
This needs to begin with creating a system make use of a
scanned the barcode on any chemical purchased to provide the use-by-date, 
to track how much they have used to date and also link to safety info.
This project will provide an opportunity to work with the farmers, supported by Dr Clark and his team,
to really help farmers co-design a good solution to their current problems in managing chemical use.
</p>

<p>
<b>Location</b>: University of Sydney for some client meetings - electronic meetings with farmers and it would be
real advantage to actually visit some of the nearer farmers to gain real understanding of their needs.

<b>Description</b>:
<br/>
This project provides the opportunity to work with GradeProof, one of Australia’s fastest growing startups.  GradeProof is an artificially intelligent cloud-based software system, which uses propriety computational linguistic algorithms to find grammatical issues, rephrase sentences, target word counts and search for plagiarism. The GradeProof mobile app has seen exponential growth since it’s launch in May, and the much anticipated web version is launching shortly. It is projected that GradeProof’s system will be used by more than 100,000 people in the next 12 months.
<p/>
GradeProof currently uses a third party system for plagiarism checks. Students on this project will remove the need for this, developing a brand new plagiarism detection system.  The software will be developed in a language of your choice, utilising publicly available search engine APIs to instantly query billions of web pages for textual similarity.  You will be guided through the development process by experts in computational linguistics, and will have the opportunity to work directly with GradeProof’s founders. Your software will potentially be deployed across all GradeProof products, used by students and business around the world.
<p/>
This project is ideally suited to students interested in:
<ul>
<li>
    public APIs
</li>
<li>
    information retrieval
</li>
<li>
    computational linguistics
</li>
<li>
    startup exposure
</li>

<b>Description</b>:
<br/>
Project Aim:
<p/>
Increase understanding about the link between emotions, dreams, sleep, fitness and wellness. 
<p/>
Project Objective:
<p/>
Develop a mobile / desktop emotion, sleep and dreams app that:
<ol>
<li>
Encourages users to input their own emotion and dream data into the app via an enjoyable user experience.
</li>
<li>
Overlays the emotion and dream data collected by the app with the sleep and fitness data collected by the wearable.
</li>
<li>
Provides enterprise level reporting with exportable colour graphs in pdf format.
</li>
</ol>
TASKS for COMP Team - API extraction, data overlays, enterprise dashboard, desktop app, graphics
<p/>
<ul>
<li>
Extract the individual fitness and sleep data from 4 wearables data centres via their API’s
</li>
<li>
Overlay of sleep and fitness data collected by the wearable with the emotion and dream data
collected by the mobile app and desktop app.
</li>
<li>
Design and develop enterprise login dashboard and reporting format for desktop app
</li>
<li>
Assistance with the design and programming of the desktop app liaising with the INFO team
for the project.
</li>
<li>
Assistance with design and development of attractive overlay graphs and reporting formats for
desktop app liaising with the INFO team for the project.
</li>
</ul>
Background
<p/>
There are a huge number of wearable fitness trackers on the market. Most of them are collecting steps data, and more recently, they are also collecting sleep information as well.
<p/>
However most of the software platforms that sync with the wearable data centre API’s are doing things with the daytime steps and fitness data but not anything with the night-time sleep data.
<p/>
There is a good opportunity for an app that can encourage users to input their emotions (by day) and or dream information (by night) into their phones or desktops. This data can then be overlayed with their daytime fitness data and night-time sleep data giving the individual, health service or enterprise with a much clearer picture about the wellness of the individual.

<p>
<b>Description</b>: A Learning Progression Tracker giving clear visibility to both the student and Supervisor
<br/>
The demand for web developers and app developers continues to outstrip the supply particularly in tech focussed centres of the USA like San Francisco and the greater Silicon Valley area.
<p/>
New learning methodologies are springing up including boot camps and on-line platforms to accelerate the attainment of skills and supply workers to a variety of tech firms based in US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong.
<p/>
This project involves working with Gerudio,
a web development boot-camp course provider that combines online learning
and face to face group based learning to produce competent web developers for Silicon valley 
employers.
<p/>
Online tutorials that constitute pre work and core foundation modules of a course need to be 
tracked and give the student and supervisor clear indications of what has been completed whilst 
simultaneously motivating students to continue progression and achieve milestones in a timely 
manner.
<p/>
By developing existing learning technologies including Canvas/Zaption and utilising a range of 
delivery platforms including Khan, Coursera, Udemy a tracking system is to be developed to make 
the learning environment more effective and responsive.
</p>

<p>
<b>Location</b>: Combination of University of Sydney meetings and Video calls to Silicon Valley team
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<b>Prerequisites and Desirable skills:</b>: 
<br/>
The company uses Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, AWS, MEAN stack.
Students who lack any of these will plan a course to learn them as part of the project work.
<p/>
Notes:  Extreme programming is very closely aligned to lean startup strategies employed by Gerudio.
Gerudio is committed to constantly launch site versions to target groups of customers including 
Universities, Colleges, schools, teachers and trainers. The feedback from these customers is used to 
produce further iterations of the product.

<b>Description</b>:
<br/>
There is an epidemic of obesity and associated health problems, compromising quality of life and life expectancy.
A key aspect of this relates to nutrition.
This project aims to tackle of the problems that people face when they decide they want to improve their diet
by increasing their intake of vegetables, to achieve recommended levels.
This problem is that the recommendations are in terms of the number of servings of vegetables;
but many people have difficulty learning what constitutes a serve.
This project will provide a fun way to tackle this,
by creating a game that helps people to learn about and practice the skill of judging vegetable serving sizes.
Other elements to explore include
text message/email to maintain motivation and social networking and leader boards.
</p>

There is an existing application to get you started.
You can use this as a foundation and also explore other technology.
Key aspects of this project are the evaluations, with real users trying out your games so you can improve the
user experience and the learning.

<b>Description</b>:
<br/>
Like the project above, this one
also aims to help people improve their nutrition.
And this, too, will use gamification.
The project is to create a
budgeting and meal design game;
users will be given a budget and go "shopping" in a virtual supermarket, 
then design a meal by dragging and dropping ingredients with the goal of staying 
within the budget and including an allocated number of serves of vegetables.
The project has considerable opportunity for exploration of creative ways to support the learning.
One set of user stories will relate to harnessing the nudging power of
text message/email to maintain motivation with achieving intake goals and tracking in the app.
Other user stories include support for people to share achievements, recipes etc using social networking.

</p>

<p>
<b>Location</b>: University of Sydney for client meetings 
</p>

<p>
<b>Prerequisites and Desirable skills:</b>: 
<br/>
The key for this project is exploring technology for creating the games and doing careful evaluations of these
and the products created.

<br/>
Background:
<br/>
<a class="non" href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/campus-flora/id918408102">CampusFlora</a>
offers an interactive map of the plants at The University of Sydney and users can share their user experience via social media. 
The App was developed in partnership with undergraduate Biology students and 
has resulted the whole of the University grounds being turned into a learning space for Botany.
This App was the first learning and teaching App in the University of Sydney’s App store. 
There has been a lot of interest from within and outside the University 
(e.g. from other university campuses here and overseas, Botanical gardens, Arboreta, local councils) to develop this app further.  
Although our context is Botany, in essence, the App is a tool to offer geolocated narratives 
and as such the system could easily be restructured to offer information for different discipline contexts 
(e.g. architecture, tourist trails). 
Earlier this year we developed and deployed the 
<a class="non" href="http://campusflora.sydneybiology.org/">CampusFlora webApp</a>
(rubyonrails database) version of the CampusFlora. 
We are yet to fully integrated the iOS with this database.  
<p/>
The project:
An analysis of the user data to date, tells us that our user-base is skewed to iDevice users. 
We need to develop a GooglePlay version of the CampusFlora app based on the existing UI of the webApp 
so that students users who have android devices are able to have the same user experience as iDevice owners. 
This is just the foundation for this project which offers considerable opportunity for creativity
and innovation.
Key to this project will be to run user feedback sessions and from this feedback implement improvements to the system. 
These will make use of best practice in usability and user experience testing (timed so that students currently
enrolled in the HCI subject will have studied the most relevant ones in time to use those skills.)

<p>
<b>Description</b>:
<br/>
The Problem:
<br/>
We currently have Homeboy apps in the iOS and Android app stores that can view security footage from cameras, control cameras and add new cameras as required (see the links below). However some of our users don’t own an iPhone or Android phone or don’t always have access to one of these devices - so we’d love to add a web-based alternative. The web UI should contain some or all of the following abilities:
<p/>
<ul>
<li>
Authenticate users via OAuth 2 (there’s a tutorial for that in our docs)
</li>
<li>
Display a real time feed of events and alerts that occur at a location (eg. videos, messages, monitoring was turned on / off)
</li>
<li>
Turn on / off security monitoring at locations. Adjust camera and location settings.
</li>
<li>
Invite other users to join Homeboy
</li>
</ul>

Plus, students should attempt to implement one or more of these advanced control features:

<ul>
<li>
Advanced control
<br/>
Add new cameras to a user’s location.
This involves stepping the user through the following process: turn on the camera's WiFi hotspot; connect the computer to the camera hotspot; ask the camera for the WiFi networks it can see; choose a network and send setup commands to the camera.
</li>
<li>
Intelligent battery conservation.
<br/>
A major selling point of Homeboy cameras is the battery life of the camera, but a major source of drain on the battery is that it 'wakes up' every minute to check what actions it should perform. By making the camera 'wake up’ less often we can increase the battery life of the camera. However the trade off is that the camera becomes less responsive to user input. The wake up time of a camera can already be controlled via a configuration mechanism. The Homeboy web UI should allow users to control the 'wake up' time of cameras. Thought should be given to the best way to communicate this tradeoff to the user.
<br/>
Further, the web UI should allow users to opt in to 'Intelligent battery conservation' - this would make dynamic wake up time changes based upon pre-existing Homeboy events such as: the user’s locale and current time; motion detection being turned on / off; or users of the system entering / leaving the home. Such a system might use simple or complex heuristics or even AI based methods to decide when to make the camera more or less responsive.
</li>
<li>
Auto configuration of 'Pet mode'.
<br/>
Pet mode allows Homeboy cameras to ignore motion events that were caused by a user's cat or dog. However, this setting can take a bit of trial and error to get right. If motion is detected by a Homeboy camera then the Web UI should allow users to choose an option like 'This is just my pet'. This information should be used to 'learn' the most appropriate setting for the user's home / pets. Students should attempt to design a system that converges on the right Pet mode setting with the least number of pet videos captured.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Description</b>:
<br/>
The Problem:
<br/>
Security systems can be a pain to turn on and off, and occasionally users can forget to turn off their system when they come home. If a user forgets to turn off their Homeboy camera then it will capture video of them entering their premises. We would like to use video analysis to recognise people in the Homeboy videos and train the system to know when a known user or an unexpected user has entered the home. This could influence our decisions on what notifications to send the user, or merely augment the users Homeboy experience.
<p/>
What we need is a stand alone application that can take as an input a Homeboy video and identify some or all of the following:
<ul>
<li>
Whether there are any people in the video, if so, how many.
</li>
<li>
Tag each person in the video using a pre-learned set of users and their videos or pictures.
</li>
<li>
Identify whether the person or persons in the video have been seen before at this location.
</li>
</ul>

The Homeboy system should then be able to make use of the output data to make decisions and augment the users Homeboy experience.
<p/>
Students may want to explore a number of different approaches to this problem, including variations in:

<ul>
<li>
the enrolment method, i.e. how users are added to the facial recognition system. Perhaps including exploring the use of still photos, close up videos or ‘naturally occurring’ videos of users in their homes.
</li>
<li>
the algorithms used to identify faces and compare them with others.
</li>
<li>
the features extracted from faces.
</li>
</ul>
Students should report on the effectiveness of each approach in identifying each of the criteria above. The final implementation may be some form of combination or hybrid of multiple approaches to the problem.

Project Aim:
<p/>
Increase understanding about the link between emotions, dreams, sleep, fitness and wellness.
<p/>
Project Objective:
<p/>
Develop a mobile / desktop emotion, sleep and dreams app that:
<ol>
<li>
Encourages users to input their own emotion and dream data into the app via an enjoyable user experience.
</li>
<li>
Overlays the emotion and dream data collected by the app with the sleep and fitness data collected by the wearable.
</li>
<li>
Provides enterprise level reporting with exportable colour graphs in pdf format.
</li>
</ol>


TASKS for INFO Team - Animation, UI, Mobile app, Application Server, Desktop App
<p/>
<ul>
<li>
Design unique input animations for users to record emotion and dreams.
</li>
<li>

Design and program good-looking user interface mobile App for Android.
</li>
<li>
Design and programming of Application server to serve Mobile App, Desktop App.
</li>
<li>
Completion of desktop app, potentially liaising with the COMP team, or creating an independent exploration of this space.
</li>
</ul>
Background
<p/>
There are a huge number of wearable fitness trackers on the market. Most of them are collecting steps data, and more recently, they are also collecting sleep information as well.
<p/>
However most of the software platforms that sync with the wearable data centre API’s are doing things with the daytime steps and fitness data but not anything with the night-time sleep data.
<p/>
There is a good opportunity for an app that can encourage users to input their emotions (by day) and or dream information (by night) into their phones or desktops. This data can then be overlayed with their daytime fitness data and night-time sleep data giving the individual, health service or enterprise with a much clearer picture about the wellness of the individual.

<b>Description</b>:
<br/>
Like this client's projects above, this one
also aims to help people improve their nutrition.
It has been well documented that careful food logging can play an extremely valuable role in helping people
achieve their target weight and then maintaining it.
A quite different need for food diaries is for nutrition researchers and for dieticians who are helping people
with difficulties related to diet and nutrition.
<p/>
This project aims to create a foundation for both the above roles, harnessing the user's personal digital ecosystem
to help them track vegetable intake.
The system will harness gamification and support a fun user experience.
It should support a goal setting feature.
It should make use of various gamification elements, such as a point meter,
where points can be accumulated from several behaviours and achievements
e.g. progressing in game, watching cooking demos, uploading images of cooked meals.
There should be other support, such as
for recording changes in mood, physical appearance, energy levels (as an intrinsic reward).

Background:
<br/>
<a class="non" href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/campus-flora/id918408102">CampusFlora</a>
offers an interactive map of the plants at The University of Sydney and users can share their user experience via social media. 
The App was developed in partnership with undergraduate Biology students and 
has resulted the whole of the University grounds being turned into a learning space for Botany.
This App was the first learning and teaching App in the University of Sydney’s App store. 
There has been a lot of interest from within and outside the University 
(e.g. from other university campuses here and overseas, Botanical gardens, Arboreta, local councils) to develop this app further.  
Although our context is Botany, in essence, the App is a tool to offer geolocated narratives 
and as such the system could easily be restructured to offer information for different discipline contexts 
(e.g. architecture, tourist trails). 
Earlier this year we developed and deployed the 
<a class="non" href="http://campusflora.sydneybiology.org/">CampusFlora webApp</a>
(rubyonrails database) version of the CampusFlora. 
We are yet to fully integrated the iOS with this database.  
<p/>
The project:
CampusFlora has received a lot of praise and attention from biologist and ecologist who want to offer their a CampusFlora at their home institution. 
This project tackles the range of impediments to this.
For example, one of these is that biologists are not necessarily sufficiently technically literate to deploy the software. 
So the project should provide an auto-install so that those wishing to deploy their own CampusFlora can get started with ease. 
Another example if that the project should
examine interoperability with other systems (like iNaturalist and ArborPlan) and to provide solutions for data transfer between systems.
This project then offers much scope for exploring other elements needed for broad, flexible but very easy use of
current software base in the ways that are needed by the professional biologist and ecologist.

<b>Description</b>:
<br/>
This project is best suited for students wanting to work for a high growth technology company, or start their own.
You will interview the CEOs of top tech companies in Australia and Silicon Valley and learn what makes them successful. 
The answers will be captured in a refined modern website that captures details on what makes the fastest 
growing companies in the world tick.
<p/>
Your work will focus on analyzing and reporting the psychological attributes of success in technology company development: determination, adaptability, team cohesiveness and ambition. This will require you to read and understand the academic research and business theories in these areas and develop a system to capture these characteristics.
<p/>
The project is led by Ben Sand. Ben Sand is a founder of Meta, a 2.5 year old Silicon Valley company, 
with $23M investment from Li Ka-Shings’ Horizons Fund, Tim Draper, Garry Tan and Alexis Ohanian. 
Its 70 employees include Iron Man interface designer Jayse Hansen, 
Soren Harner who grew Atlassian from 10 to 100 engineers, 
Professors Steve Mann (inventor of wearable computing) and 
Professor Steve Feiner (25,000 citations for his research into interfaces). 
<p/>
Meta’s founding team met at Sydney University. 
Ben led Meta’s successful application to Y Combinator and developed strategy to help the company raise money, 
market it’s products and hire staff.
<p/>
In collaboration with universities and local governments in Queensland, 
Ben is working with local tech companies to bring $20M in investment into Queensland by the end of 2015, and $2Bn to Australia by the end of 2018. This project will help gather data to support these efforts.
<p/>
If you’d like to learn how to build or support high growth tech company, apply to join Ben Sand on this project.
