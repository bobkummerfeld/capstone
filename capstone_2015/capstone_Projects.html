<b>Description</b>: 
The clients work with people who have atrial fibrillation and need to work
out how to manage their health effectively,
following the evidence from the latest research on best practice. 
The driver for this project is that there have been particularly successful
nurse-led electronic decision support tools in overseas contexts.
The clients would like to develop a tool for the Australian setting. The focus would be on
adherence to guidelines for medication and lifestyle. The tool would facilitate 
discussions and give illustrations of risk so that participants could make informed choices
about treatment in consultation with a skilled clinical nurse. The interface needs to be
acceptable to older participants. It could be on a web browser or a mobile app.
A tablet would be ideal for older people. 

<p/>
The clients include a researcher from
a major international study and he would be involved in
the development of this proposed tool (see the link below to the main findings). The guidelines
are international, but the Australian healthcare system is quite different, so there are
both opportunities and hurdles here we need to overcome!
<p/>
Students will be able to work with nurses and consumers, to really have an impact.

<b>Description</b>: 

This project gives you an opportunity to make use of a new database of
Australian foods and their nutritional breakdown,
to create an iphone app that will help tackle 
obesity and chronic diseases.
These diseases cause immense suffering by individuals and also
place enormous financial pressure on economies such as Australia.  
However, it is possible to reduce their impact with changes to be lifestyle.
Importantly, diet is a key for 
prevention and treatment of many chronic diseases.
If people can easily log their food, this can provide the foundation
for helping them improve their diets.
Unfortunately, traditional methods of measuring diet have many disadvantages. 
But new technologies should change this by making it very
easy for a person to record the food they eat, on the spot, when they eat.
This is valuable to share with their health care practitioner. 
<p/>
The aim of
this project is to produce the first iphone app that will make use of the new
database of Australian foods loaded (released May 2014). The app must
have usability testing for both the participant who will use it and the
health professional that will need a back end to assess the nutritional
content and quality and make recommendations. The real challenge here
is in making the search of the almost 5000 food varieties easy.
This is a chance to work with the client and her team of nutrition experts
to explore creative ways to make it fun and easy to record food eaten.
The app will also help people easily estimate their portion size accurately.
This might make use of short
videos and other approaches that you test with people.

<b>Description</b>: 

Compressed gases and cryogenic liquids can pose as a major hazard in the
laboratory environment as there is a risk of oxygen depletion and
asphyxiation, oxygen enrichment and fire or harmful health effects. To assist
workers in determining the risk of these materials in the workspaces at the
University of Sydney, Safety Health and Wellbeing wish to create a web based
tool that will calculate oxygen levels when there has been a catastrophic
release of gas. 
<p/>
Currently there is a Microsoft Excel based tool which contains five
calculation spreadsheets for different risk scenarios. 
This project is aimed at transferring the spreadsheet calculations to a web
based interface.

<b>Description</b>:
In each semester, the School of Physics offers over 30 different experiments in Senior Physics
Laboratory for the students (about 90 registered for doing lab) to undertake and to earn
certain credit points.
<p/>
In doing Software Development project two years ago, a group of IT students from School of IT,
developed a web-based booking system for Senior Physics Lab. The system was written in ruby on
rails, a well-known web application development framework.
<p/>
The developed system serves three types of users: students (registered for doing experiments
in the Lab), tutors (about 10 academic staff members in physics marking students' work)
and administrator (laboratory manager).
<p/>
Students use the system to book times for doing some experiments and to view marks of their
work. Tutors use it to record the marks of students' work. Admin uses it to manage
students, tutors, experiments, students' booking, work and marks.
<p/>
The system is at the point of its development cycle where after its preliminary usage for the
lab, the client brings the feedback to the developers and requests for its further
improvement. Here listed are a few but not all issues,
<p/>
&#8211; Make on-line booking more fairly among all students.<br/>
&#8211; Manage the experiments with different timetables<br/>
&#8211; Add scheduling function for students' final presentations<br/>
&#8211; Add email facilities.
<p/>
As software developers, you are expected to confidently response to our requests.
In doing this project, the students will be able to quickly gain skills in Ruby-on- Rails and
MySQL because the code of system mainframe is already available. The students will also have
an opportunity to conquer more challenging problems based on the first version of the system.

<b>Description</b>: 
Real-time timetable information has helped to reduce some of the uncertainty of using
public transport but the other uncertainties such as crowding, comfort and frustrating
experiences also have a significant influence on people's travel choices. The RateIT
project involves working with transport researchers, a bus operator, and real-time
transport information to develop a real-time app that demonstrates the value of engaging
passengers and transport operators about the quality of public transport in real-time.

The RateIT project involves designing and developing a working online app that can be used
to collect and disseminate crowdsourced passenger-to-passenger information in real-time
and to design and develop the back-end systems that will enable transport operators to
capture, interact and respond to real-time information provided by passengers about
service quality and passenger experience. The project involves testing of the online app
and back-end systems during a one month field trial with bus passengers.

<b>Description</b>:
A/Prof Corinne Caillaud, Dr Sarah Lewis, Dr Melanie Nguyen, Dr Debra Shirley, Tina Barclay and
Xuan Luu are the 2014 Vice-Chancellor Award Winners for their project, Belong@FHS: Peer
Mentoring Across the Faculty of Health Sciences. We will extend on this success by expanding
the support of the student experience through use of advanced material design, information
architecture and adaptive interaction.
<p/>
The aim of our proposed project is to use the student support principles from our experiences
to create a very special, dynamic, intuitive way of communicating between students across all
years of study and their University. We are thinking of a tool (App or web based) using
various aspects of user experience and information architecture designs to create a unique
interface between users (students) and the organisation (The University).  While you and your
team will be designing this tool, our role will be in the content design, implementation and
evaluation. The substantial software system designed by you will be promoted at conferences
with the aim of nation-wide implementation, ideally, with the support of the Office of
Learning & Teaching.
<p/>
As a client, we will provide an Educational Designer with a background in UX to facilitate
requirements gathering, prototyping, user testing and exploring foundations of sensing,
learning, decision making, search & retrieval, and human-computer interaction of this system.
The ultimate aim is to refine collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms and methods for
recommending content to students based on the analysis of the behaviour of a large number of
their peers. Note, this is not a website re-design but a transformative approach to the
student experience.

This project aims to improve the knowledge linkages between academics, corporations and
government. Finding subject matter experts is a time and resource intensive task for
businesses and individuals alike. We want to use sophisticated topic modeling algorithms
to gauge the expertise of different researchers and academics and manifest this
information through an online portal. To ensure this information is easily accessible the
portal intends to represent a visual interactive network map alongside an optimized search

<b>Description</b>:
This app will facilitate end-users of built environment to contribute informed opinions in
the decision-making process leading up to the design and construction of built environment
projects. A key feature is the use of geo-located augmented reality technology (GAR), to
allow non-experts to view design proposals in a format that is closer to their lived
experience and therefore readily comprehendible. 

<br/>

IT Components
This project involves five core components of user-interface (UI) development:
communication considerations;
technical infrastructure;
advanced interactive features;
iOS coding;
PHP/HTML setup.
A standard usability test will be conducted to ascertain the performance of the final product
in actual deployment conditions.

Problem to solve:
<br/>
The developing world is rapidly gaining access to the Internet, the first thing they want to
do when connected is to get a job and earn money. In order to earn money they need the
education required to perform a satisfactory level of work and there needs to be some evidence
for potential employers that the freelancers they are hiring possess the skills required. 
<p/>
This project aims to take advantage of the large community of Freelancer.com and allow them to
learn new skills, and showcase their new knowledge to aid them in finding new work in areas
they couldn’t before.

Current Standing:
Freelancer.com offers a service wherein users can take exams to verify their skills
All questions require multiple choice answers
Freelancers can currently suggest questions which may appear in future exams, but the
questions need to be manually reviewed and updated by Freelancer.com staff
<p/>
Goals: 
<br/>
Create a new standalone service where users can take courses to learn new life skills, find a
wider range of work on Freelancer.com by showcasing these skills, and expand their knowledge
into areas not possible for them before, at less cost than a traditional educational
institution
Integrate this course/exam service with existing Freelancer.com so that users are able to
showcase their skills when applying for jobs
Allow a system where exams are completely crowd sourced by the community
Implement online courses tailored to teach the material examined in exams
Allow courses to also be crowdsourced and curated by the community

<b>Description</b>: 

APProve is a double-blind randomised clinical trial that aims to assess the effectiveness of using probiotics to
prevent infection in breastfeeding women during the first two months after giving birth. To support this trial, a
smart phone application (APProve-App) is required to collect information critical to administering and running
the trial as well as being a source of information about the trial to participants. Information collected will
include; date of delivery and discharge, clinical symptoms of infection (trial outcome), and compliance with
treatment regimen. The application should also support compliance with the treatment and information collection
by providing reminders and instructions where required. The application must "evolve" through three stages; trial
recruitment, treatment allocation and treatment. The application should be intuitive and easy to use and look
appropriate for a professional medical clinical trial. The application should be robust to differing versions of
iOS and Android systems and be capable of sending collected information daily, in a form suitable for integration
with a centralised trial SQL database.

<b>Description</b>:

The Kolling Institute of Medical Research is a leading centre of health and medical research in NSW.
It aims to uncover the basis of disease and translate that knowledge to the clinic to better
patient health and wellbeing.
Its research is broad, encompassing "lifespan" conditions including:
pregnancy and childbirth to
cancer and genetics,
kidney and heart disease,
pain and neurological disorders,
diseases of bones and joints and
tissue regeneration.
<p/>
This project aims to create software to collect performance metrics.
Discussions with the client will be key in identifying diverse ways to do this effectively.
These include ways to collect better data about the patient experience,
ranging from simple feedback to patient stories.
At a quite different level, the project aims to capture more formal impact of
publications.

<b>Description</b>:

This project aims to create a portal that helps patients become well informed partners
in their medical care and decision making.
For example, a pregnant woman may need to consider many options, such as those
relating to pre-natal screening, medications, delivery options.
Kolling conducts research and clinics in a broad range of "lifespan" conditions
and many call for decisions that can be challenging for patients.
</>
Working with the client, the team would create a web site that enables the staff
to flexibly create materials that a patient can work through,
at their own pace, considering the options and information relating to their
decision options.
This can serve as a foundation for consultations with the medical staff.

Large corporations and government organisations want to innovate but
don't often get the opportunity to engage with innovators in a
meaningful way. PwC's Innovation team have developed a process
called Open Innovation. Combining aspects of Design Thinking, Lean
Startup methodologies, Jobs to be Done theory, the Hackathon and the
Startup Weekend - Open Innovation brings together industry experts and
the startup and developer communities to create solutions to problems
worth solving. In order to be able to manage and market this process
effectively, we need an Event Management System that satisfies the
requirements of both internal and external stakeholders - baking in the
unique privacy and security requirements of our top-tier clients - and
leveraging the latest web and mobile technologies to make the entire
workflow - from creation and registration, to attendance and follow-up
(and everything in-between) - as smooth and customer-friendly as
possible.

<b>Description</b>:
A rare opportunity to join an early startup venture in its infancy. The project would consist
of developing a web based booking engine for a new and emerging industry. The site would
allow users to browse, book, purchase (via Stripe), rate and review products. There would
also be a supplier portal implementation for secure login and management. The project would
allow students to gain complete web design experience from beginning to end, including
database design, frontend development, security, scalability, payment integration, etc. The
choice of technology would be completely open to the students' discretion, other than the
requirement of mySQL for the backend. Students would join a very entrepreneurial environment
where they would be given creative flexibility and encouraged to incorporate their own ideas
into the design. Not only would students be able to put their names to a working commercial
product but also be given the chance to network with professionals across the IT industry.

<b>Description</b>:
Didgeepop is a start-up, just 6 months old.
In this project, you will build a prototype for a digital receipt management
platform. This aims to replace existing paper receipts at the point of
sale during retail shopping. We have already agreed on a digital receipt
standard with a global standards body (GS1) and this will be the basis for the
design.
<p/>
The solution will include mobile apps (built using
http://www.telerik.com/platform) and a backend webservice platform. 
The preferred technology is the Zend Framework and PHP
but open to other languages (Java, C# etc.) being used. 
We also want the design to enable the solution to be white-labelled
so a strong architecture is required. 
We also provide full use of Amazon Webservice (AWS)
technology and would like the solution to include DynamoDB
(http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for performance.
<p/>
Be part of an actual real-life start-up and a truly disruptive technology and who
knows where you will end up as we will be fund raising during this time and
looking to launch later in the year.

<b>Description</b>:
This is a project to build the ultimate holographic workstation. An app
currently exists in the glasses that provides the ability to create an
unlimited number of holographic iPads, that could display video, text,
web pages or apps. The project is to connect many web services to these
panels (think top 20 websites) and place them in the environment in a
de-cluttered way. Prof. Baldassi's expertise is in visual perception
and performance and he will guide you through running experiments on how
to increase the quantity of information in the environment without
overwhelming the user. The interface you build will resemble these
graphics: 
<a href="http://youtu.be/7SFeCgoep1c?t=22s">

<a href="http://youtu.be/YAXsZphpiu8?t=3m37s">
http://youtu.be/YAXsZphpiu8?t=3m37s</a>
<br/>
<p/>
This app is ideally suited to students interested in:
<ul> 
<li> the human visual system </li>
<li> APIs </li>
<li> power user interfaces </li>
</ul>
Prior to Meta Prof. Baldassi was a visiting professor at Stanford where
he specialised in the understanding of depth perception within visual
interfaces. There are over 11 cues your mind uses to understand depth
(focus, convergence, movement, occlusion and many others). Prof.
Baldassi will guide you in addressing these depth cues so you can create
beautiful and highly functional layered interfaces. Elliot Diebold is a
Sydney University alum and Meta Engineer.
The project will be built in Unity3D using C#. You will be supplied with
graphics assets, and only programming is required, however we welcome
creative extensions that fit within the subject outcomes.

Meta is the first full 3D system. 3D input and 3D output. The most
requested application for Meta is the ability to take the output of
every 3D design package (AutoCad, 3D Studio Max, Maya, Blender, etc.)
and visualize it in on the table in front of you or floating in the
space around you. You will refine and extend the killer ability of Meta:
to allow multiple people to visualize and interact with the same 3D
content.

This project is ideally suited to students interested in:
<ul> 
<li> 3D design tools </li>
<li> collaborative user interfaces </li>

<b>Description</b>:
You will create the ability to see through another person's eyes and
guide them, by overlaying holograms onto their view. The remote
assistance application has been requested by an incredible variety of
people, including: national space agencies, power station operators,
premium car companies, piano instructors and doctors working in the
developing world. Essentially any use case where an expert is at a
distance from where their expertise is needed.
<p/>
The app you build will allow wearers of the Meta glasses to supply a
link to a person working remotely from them. That link opens a web page
showing a video feed from the glasses. The web user can drag holograms
and panels into the view of the person they are assisting. Imagine a 3D
overlay of human anatomy being transmitted to a doctor so it appears
above the patient they are operating on, or a hovering holographic 3D
marker arriving above the real switch an astronaut should flip to open
the correct airlock.

<b>Description</b>:
The Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute (VCCRI), established in 1994, is recognised as
an international centre of excellence in biomedical research, with a focus on heart
disease and cardiovascular biology. It places a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary
approaches within and across its research divisions, which are focused on Developmental
and Stem Cell Biology, Cardiac Physiology and Transplantation, Molecular Cardiology &
Biophysics, Vascular Biology and Molecular, Structural and Computational Biology. The
Institute is housed in a state-of-the-art research building located within the St
Vincent's Hospital Research & Biotechnology Precinct in the Inner Sydney suburb of
Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia.
<p/>
Multiple bioinformatics projects are available in the Bioinformatics and Systems Medicine
Laboratory and the Computational Cardiology Laboratory at the VCCRI. The students will be
part of a highly interdisciplinary team, and will work on specific software development
project in association with on-going research activities with local and international
collaborators.
<p/>
<b>About this project:</b>
The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has enabled the generation of
genomic data at unprecedented rates, posing major challenges for analysis and
visualisation. The Ho laboratory at the VCCRI is involved in an international
collaboration that involves generation and analysis of hundreds of genome-wide datasets of
various fungal genomes. To facilitate collaboration among biologists and bioinformaticians
in different geographical locations, we propose to build a web-based genome browser that
can handle a large amount of epigenomic data. In our project, we propose to develop a
fast, interactive, and collaborative web-based genome browser that supports large-scale
epigenomic analysis. Students will extend existing state-of-the-art HTML5 genome browsers
(e.g., 
<a href="http://www.biodalliance.org/">
http://www.biodalliance.org/)</a>, 
with additional functionalities that support
comparative analysis and collaborative research.

<b>Description</b>:
Defects in the electrical activity of heart cause ~12% of adult deaths in the developed
world. Multi-scale computational modelling of the heart is now recognised as a powerful
technique for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of cardiac electrical
activity. Computational approaches have allowed us to tease out important relations
between parameters, which are not possible using current laboratory techniques. Until now,
however, the application of computational methods has been limited by the enormous
computational burden of current cardiac models. We overcome this computational limitation
by applying General Purpose Graphical Processing Units (GPGPU).  In this project we plan
to automate the conversation of traditional CPU-based code to GPU-based code by
implementing a code generator. We need to build a software system that receives a
mathematical model expressed in a specific XML format (called CellML) and then generates
an OpenCL solver for the model (We have a python module that generates C++ solvers, this
module can be a good starting point).

<b>Description</b>:
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a time series of data representing electrical activity of
the heart. For over 100 years it has been applied by cardiologists to diagnose many life
threatening cardiac diseases. Using state-of-art machine learning and signal processing
methods, we have shown that there is a wealth of useful new information that can be
extracted from ECGs that could be used to improve the diagnosis and management of a range
of cardiac disorders. To show the effectiveness of our methods we need access to a large
database of ambulatory ECG recordings. We are in the process of establishing a large
collaboration with hospitals across NSW to build an integrated web-based data repository
for our study. We need to build a web-based system that will enable our
(local/international) collaborators to upload relatively large data files (~4GB per
patient).We estimate that the database will need to hold ~5000 data files. We want to run
some back-end post processing on the data and provide collaborators the ability to
query/download information from this dataset.
